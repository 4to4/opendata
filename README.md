# GeoJSON Data/File  

## Validate GeoJSON Prior to Commiting Your Work    
[GeoJSON Lint](http://geojsonlint.com/) is a web service that will validate GeoJSON files; Simply copy and paste the contents of the file into the site's <code>textarea</code> section, and click the "Test GeoJSON" button below.  
If you have errors, you'll be alerted via modals, pointing to the code line with an explanation.  
Correct the errors until the file passes the linting process; you'll know this happens when the map automatically loads the contents of the GeoJSON file.
